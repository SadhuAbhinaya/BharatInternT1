        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
            I am thrilled to introduce myself as a passionate and motivated 
            with a strong foundation in Python, Java, C, and HTML&CSS. As a recent graduate in computer science,
            I have honed my programming skills and developed a keen interest in creating innovative solutions using 
            these versatile technologies.
            C has taught me the importance of low-level programming and memory management. Working with C has allowed
            me to understand the inner workings of computers and has contributed to my ability to optimize code for performance.
            Java has been another significant part of my learning experience, and I am fascinated by its object-oriented paradigm. 
            I have implemented several applications and gained insights into building robust and scalable software with Java. 
            Its "write once, run anywhere" capability intrigues me, as it enables us to cater to diverse platforms effortlessly.
            Alongside these programming skills, I have also dabbled in HTML, which forms the backbone of web development.
             Understanding HTML's structure has allowed me to create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages.

            <h3>SMART BOREWELL</h3>
            <p>
                A smart bore well provided with a lid comprises an ultrasonic sensor, an arduino board, a servo motor, bary module and custom controlled software application. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance using basic sound waves. The arduino board provided to receive signals from sensor and operate the servo motor in closing the lid.
                The servo motors are used for precise control of angular position, velocity and acceleration
                The ultrasonic sensor alerts the arduino by detecting the approaching to operate the servo motor in closing of lid

            <h3>TO DO LIST </h3>
            <p>A to do list is a list of tasks you set out to do ordered according to the level of importance.
                It is an important part of planning big events, projects, and classwork.
                It helps you delegate tasks, space your time, and keep your priorities in order.
                It also gives you a clear picture of what you need to get done and a peace of mind that you have a plan in place.
                A to do list can be made the night before or first thing in the morning.
                It can be used by different people from different spheres. 
                However, it may lack clarity and prioritization and sometimes lead to procrastination if not used properly
